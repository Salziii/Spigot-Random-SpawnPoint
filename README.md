# Random Spawn Point

## Description
Gives you a random location in an arbitrarily adjustable x and z boundary and the highest possible y coordinate.

## FAQ
### Why should you use it?
Unlike conventional methods, this also works in other minecraft dimensions because it returns the highest possible and not the highest point

### How to use?
Add the function to a class in your Spigot Api plugin project and import the missing dependencies

### You don't know how to use your own configuration?
Check out my other repository with my config manager
